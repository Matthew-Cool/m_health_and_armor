This is available on steam here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2469232225 

Do not use this as this may break this script or others because of the poor naming of folders and etc. It is rare for this to happen but it can. 

Also this script can be abused easly by net messages.


Look at my m_general_store for a fix for both of these problems, I cannot fix this at the moment. If you need help, you can reach out through steam! ;)
